    "Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: Because its a human readable, writable  language and its converted to machine level using interpreter. Its has wide range of use so called general purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: Because you dont need to specify data type during declaration of variable and the data type is decided on the go on the basis of value assigned to the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: Pros - Easy to read/write, not statiscally typed (dynamic), wide range of libraries available, great open source support\n",
    " Cons - Its slow compared to c++, java as its not compiled and interpreted line by line on the go. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: data science, data analytics, big data, data engineering, software development, web development\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: variables are placeholders for changing values. In python its the name given to a memory location to which it points or refers to in memory. For eg: a = 5, a is variable name pointing to a memory loc where 5 (int data type) is stored. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: Using the input function. And type casting is required to get input in desired data type for any successful operations as input function by default returns string data type. \n",
    " a = input('Enter name:')\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?\n",
    " Ans: string\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. What is type casting?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: converting data type to another type. For eg : str to int\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: Yes we can take multiple inputs from user using single input() using unpacking and .split() method of string class(data type). which will give result in form of list and we unpack it using multiple catching variables like a,b,c.\n",
    "     Eg: a,b,c = [int(x) for x in input(\"enter 3 no/: \").split()]\n",
    "Q10. What are keywords?\n",
    " \n",
    " Ans: keywords are reserved words in python having specific purpose which cannot be used to define variable names. Eg: list, tuple, or, and, False, True etc.\n",

    "     'else' when all 'if' and 'elif' condition are not satisfied then only 'else' gets executed and tells  what the program should do or how should it behave.\n",
    "\n",

    "      2) When 'elif' satisfied 'if' and 'else' wont be executed.\n",
    "      3) When multiple 'elif', whichever 'elif' get satisfied, program ends there.\n",
